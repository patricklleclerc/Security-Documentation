### Connecting to BeEF Server

**_For our Hackathon we have built a "Public" BeEF Server that we will use to demonstrate client-side browser attacks and vulnerability testing. This server has been built and hosted in Linode and can be accessed by following the below steps._**

1. Go to [Linode Login](https://login.linode.com/login)
2. ssh root@173.255.225.239
  - **_Note: If you have an approved Public SSH Key, you will not be prompted for a password. If you have not added a Public SSH Key, you will be required to login with a password._**

2. ```rvm ruby```
